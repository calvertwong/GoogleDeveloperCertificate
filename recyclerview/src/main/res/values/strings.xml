    <string name="rv_horizontal_endless_circular_explain"><b>Endless Circular Horizontal Recycler View</b>\nThis endless circular recycler view
        can be scrolled "endlessly". However, we are able to see the endless effect because we are using a large number as the view holder\'s
        position.\n\nHere is an explanation that might help you understand, imagine your first item is at position (2<sup>31</sup> - 1 divide 2 =
        1073741823) and you have scroll through 1073741823 times to reach 0<sup>th</sup> or (2<sup>31</sup> - 10) <sup>th</sup> position. This is
        how a recycler view achieves the endless effect.
